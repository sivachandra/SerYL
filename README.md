# SerYL

`SerYL` (pronounced *serial*) is a system to serialize structured data to YAML
(and hence the name `SerYL` which is short for *"Serialize to YAML"*). Think
Google protocol buffers but instead of the `.proto` files and the binary
representation of the proto messages, it is all YAML in `SerYL`. The aim is to
make it easy to share structured data between different systems in a popular
format, as opposed to protobuf goals of efficient transport and storage. Also,
the `SerYL` system is built using LLVM infrastructure to make it easy to adopt
it in LLVM projects.

NOTE: Some form of efficient storage and transport can still be achieved using
text compression techniques.

## Examples

See the `examples` directory for structured data definitions, and their
corresponding C++ representations. The structured data is defined in the YAML
format in files with extension `.ycd` (for **Y**AML **C**lass **D**efinition).
The C++ header files in the `examples` directory were generated using SerYL
from the corresponding `.ycd` files in the directory.

## Status

As of this writing, the implementaion is incomplete and not up to the standard
acceptable for an LLVM project. However, it is good enough to generate C++
header files from simple `.ycd` files. The header files in the `examples`
directory were generated by `SerYL`.

## TODO

- Add support for imports
- Add support for the `oneof` fields.
