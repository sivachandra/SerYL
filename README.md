# SerYL

`SerYL` (pronounced *serial*) is a system to serialize structured data to YAML
(and hence the name *SerYL* which is short for *"Serialize to YAML"*). Think
Google protocol buffers but instead of the `.proto` file and the binary
representation of the proto messages, it is all YAML in `SerYL`. The aim is to
make it easy to share structured data between different systems in popular
format, as opposed to protobuf goals of efficient transport and storage. Also,
the `SerYL` system is built using LLVM infrastructure to make it easy to adopt
it in LLVM projects.

## Examples

See the `examples` directory for structured data definitions are their
corresponding C++ representations. The structured data is defined in the YAML
format in files with extension `.ycd` (for **Y**AML **C**lass **D**efinition).
The C++ header files were generated by *SerYL*. They correspond to the class
definitions in the `.ycd` files.
